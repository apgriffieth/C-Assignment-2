# C-Assignment-2
This program contains a mini Fantasy Player Fun Tool with 3 different options. The first option simulates a dice game between 2 players where the user picks how many sides the die have and how many rolls. The second option creates a random fantasy character giving it a race, name, class, and alliance. Finally the third option compares the outputs of functions and macros.
